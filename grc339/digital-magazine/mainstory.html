                            <p>Tanya Ravichandran, a vibrant 23-year-old South Asian creative force, is not just participating in the fashion and beauty landscape – she’s actively reshaping it. As a creative director, photographer, and content creator, Tanya brings a fresh and vital perspective to the industry. Her work is deeply rooted in two core principles: a strong commitment to sustainability and a passionate drive for cultural inclusion. Notably, Tanya’s vision extends to creating meaningful space and representation for South Asian women within a field where their</p>

                            <p>First up: a rolling rack lined with runway treasures, like the Dior leather mirror pants from F/W 2002 collection. "They were my dream to get because they use mirror work from artisans in Rajasthan,” Ravichandran says, referencing how mirrors are a beloved Indian textile. “It's so special to me." Next, two Prada sets from the late '90s: a mirrored leather skirt, trench, and bag and a tiled white camisole and pleated skirt. Lastly, she pulls out the famed Alexander McQueen Supercalifragilistic beige net “milkmaid” corseted cocktail dress. Tanya herself is floating across the room wearing a deer-print lace-up top and skirt combo—Yves Saint Laurent from the Tom Ford circa 2002—that looks like it was made just for her. Later, she unveils a S/S 1996 Maison Martin Margiela sequin print Trompe L'Oeil Maxi Dress and opera tabby gloves, both of which are also currently on display at The Metropolitan Museum of Art.</p>

                            <p>Ravichandran, whose fashion approach is rooted in sustainability and cultural inclusion, took a non-prescriptive path to collecting archival pieces. Growing up in Cupertino, California, she wasn’t exactly surrounded by fashion lovers like herself. "My parents used to always say you can only be three things in life: an engineer, a doctor, or a loser,” she says. “I knew I needed to do something separate from anything my parents could control.".</p>
                            <p>Enter: photography. When Tanya was just 10 years old, Instagram was taking off, and she started snapping photos of her friends. As one of the first photographers on the app, she began building a devoted online community, brick by brick. "I have a very educated audience of South Asian women, and they always let me know what's up,” she says. “I've learned a lot, and I'm really grateful for them."</p>
